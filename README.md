## Predictive Policing for Robberies in New York Cities 

This project involed working with multiple datasets (nyc crime data, nyc socio economic factors, nyc shp file etc) and thus lot of data preprocessing was involved. Once we had a master dataset, we did k-means clustering to classify our dataset. This led us to have a dataset with three class(low, mid, high) as a target variable. On this, we performed various models and analysed using ROC, AUC to find the best suitable model that will help in predicting the crime rate.
